My name's Lukas, I'm living in Switzerland and I'm studying CS at HSR Rapperswil. Additionally, I'm working part-time and I'm currently changing jobs. Get back to me in September :)

This is a new attempt at writing my blog. I'm moving from Wordpress for some reasons, especially because it keeps messing up my preformatted code.

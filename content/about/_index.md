My name's Lukas, I'm living in Switzerland and I'm studying CS at HSR Rapperswil. Additionally, I'm working part-time and I'm currently changing jobs. Get back to me in September :)

This is a new attempt at writing my blog. I'm moving from Wordpress, mostly because it seems like legacy software to me and it can't decide on how to render my posts. Especially code listings break every other edit. And I also like Markdown and Wordpress seems to support it. But again, it can't decide on if it needs to render it as HTML or if that's already done.

This blog is now based on Hugo, a static site generator. All posts are on [GitHub](https://github.com/lroellin/blog) which gives us version control - so you can check the history of my blog posts. I added a little link to its history on each post.

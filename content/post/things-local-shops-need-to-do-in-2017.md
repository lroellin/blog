Online shopping is more and more common but we still need local shops. However, we don't need them for the same things anymore (that was, just getting stuff). Now, shops need to provide services that online shops simply can't. If they do it well, I pay more than what I pay for at an online shop.

Please note that some of these rules may seem contradictory, this is because I do see that it's not that simple. This is just a post of what I want of a local shop.

# Have stuff in stock

The thing I like the most about local shops is that you can go into the store and just pick it up. When buying online, you usually have to wait at least until tomorrow. This means however that I expect a shop to actually have stuff in stock that I want. I know that having a shop at an expensive location shouldn't have that much space wasted just for storage, but that's one of the things I expect.

Since I always get confused about server and client in the X Window System, I decided to write this short post. Maybe it helps you aswell.

I usually get confused because X is network-capable. You're working from a terminal on a mainframe. You would usually call the terminal the client and the mainframe the server. In this particular example, the X nomenclature is reversed.
# X Server
The X server is where the display, the keyboard and mouse (usually called a *seat) are. When you click on something or press a key, the X server sends a message to the X client.

This means: the X server runs on the computer where there's GUI input/output.
# X Client
The X client is the application telling the X server what to display and handling the commands coming from the server.

So two things:

* The X server sends data *interactively* to the X client - usually a *client* commands a server interactively
* The software in front of the user is the X server - usually the software in front of the user is the *client*
Hope this helps!

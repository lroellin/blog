Since Netflix is now available in Switzerland too, I wanted to try on my new Samsung with the Smart TV Hub. Netflix was already pre-installed, so this was no problem. 

I like to watch series in English, but this didn't work. When I tried to switch audio language, there was nothing but silence. Switching back did not work either. 

It turned out, that you have to pause while/after switching language, and then press play again. Audio will then pick up again in your desired language

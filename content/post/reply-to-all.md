I think you've all been in this situation: you send an email and after some time, you want to follow up. Maybe you didn't receive a reply, maybe you forgot something. So how do you send an email with the exact same receiver(s) easily, probably with the same subject?  

It turns out, that for some reason, Reply to All does exactly that. I actually got no logical explanation for that, since the normal Reply just composes a message back to you.

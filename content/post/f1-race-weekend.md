This post will tell you all about a typical F1 race weekend, from a spectator's position.

The actual racing starts on Friday, with Free Practice (FP1) and FP2, each 1.5h long. On Saturday morning, there's FP3, which is just one hour long.

In free practice, the drivers basically see how the car behaves on that track and they gather a lot of data for the engineers. This is where you might also see testings, the recent halo tests for drivers were done in these FP sessions. The teams may also fit some new aero component and see how this works out. I guess these FP sessions have become more important as teams can't just test how much they feel like.

Today I had to find out where a time object was used. I could find it in the current policy package, but "Where used" told me it's in other packages as well. "Where used" closes though whenever you switch policy packages, so I had to find it again. 

Turns out that it's not in the normal Objects List pane on the bottom. To access it, go to the top menu > Manage > Time. You can find "Where used" and other commands on the Actions button.

It turns out, that on some TVs (at least on our Samsung HG39EB670) the top most jack supports AV single picture, if the other Component picture jacks aren't connected.

At our Samsung HG39EB670 it does support AV on the menu, so a close look at the back revealed that the top most jack is for the single picture cable (the yellow one)

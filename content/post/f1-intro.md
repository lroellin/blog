In this series, I want to tell you all you need to know to get more out of F1. How a race weekend works, how the tire changes work, all that stuff.

I'm by no means a racing driver, I'm just a spectator for about 5 years now. It should probably also be titled "things you might wonder when watching F1", but that title was too long ;)

Here's a link that will take you to <a href="/series/formula-1-for-beginners">all the posts in this series</a>. Have fun!

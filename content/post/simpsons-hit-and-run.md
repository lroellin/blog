This morning, I glanced at my games and saw this old one lying around. I got it at a Secret Santa about 8 years ago.

After installing (you don't need a license key for this, how trustful is that?), the game doesn't even load quick past the title screen. Everything related to loading is sloooow and the game seems bugging.

To let it run, set the compatibility mode to **Windows 98/ME**. That also set the affinity to only one CPU core, which helps.

After that, it seems to load just fine :)

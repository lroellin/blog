Some months ago, I finally finished Sons of Anarchy. I can see why people think it repeats too much (it's actually a cycle), but that doesn't stop it from being great.

The best thing about SOA is the music. If you haven't noticed, almost every song was re-recorded for the show. And if that's not good enough, it's mostly the actresses singing. 

How about Gemma? She's a real badass and you get to appreciate her in the later seasons. She sings many, many songs. Some I like the most:

For a Dancer

Bird on a Wire

Then there's this masterpiece, although not by Sagal. Jack Savoretti, Soldier's Eyes

The best thing about it all, almost every song from the show can be found on Spotify, already sorted into albums by season.  There's tons of other songs I can't show you because of copyright issues on YouTube.

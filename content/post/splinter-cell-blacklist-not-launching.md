I just wanted to try out Splinter Cell: Blacklist again. I downloaded it via UPlay (don't have it on Steam). The game wouldn't start though. It always just lingered around in the Task Manager.

Turns out, the game hates when you instal it to another location than the default one. So just install it where it wants to be, drive C:. I haven't tried moving it, and it's kinda bad because this is my SSD and I don't want to have 20GB of games on it. But I'll just live with it...

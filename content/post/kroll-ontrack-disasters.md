Kroll does an annual top ten list of their worst data disasters. It seems difficult however to find them all. Since I wanted to read them all, here are the ones I've found:

My favourite is this one:

> Laptops are not waterproof â€“ Relaxing on a beach, a gentleman brought his laptop on his holiday to stay caught up on e-mails. When the midday temperatures started to soar, he decided to go for a swim. A little bit wary of leaving his laptop unattended, he popped it into a plastic bag so it would not get wet and went for a dip - laptop and all. The bag did not prove as durable as he hoped, and the laptop got soaked and he lost his data.

I recently got a FortiGate 20C, but there was a password and various other configurations on it. Because I didn't need them, I wanted to reset it.

There is a reset button which you can use with a paperclip. However, you have to do this within the **first 30 seconds after boot** (Power and Status light shine green). When it's registering a successful reset button click, the Status light blinks. When it stops blinking, the box will reset to factory settings.
